# FingerTracking
To create the program that will perform hand tracking, we will need two Python libraries. These are openCV and MediaPipe.
You can install openCV and MediaPipe by typing following commands in the terminal:
MediaPipe: ```pip install mediapipe```
openCV: ```pip install opencv-python```

Use FingerTracking.py as your main file and create a file having name handTrackingModule.py. Try to keep them in the same directory for proper working.
If you get any error, just let me know... I am always here to help you :)
